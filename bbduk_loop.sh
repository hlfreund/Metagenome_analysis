# ref ---> file provided by bbduk that holds collection of Illumina TruSeq adapters
# literal=(sequence here) ---> literal adapter sequences to remove; "N" represents any base -- in this case, they are indexes within the adapters
# rcomp=t ---> Rcomp looks for kmers and their reverse-complements, rather than just forward kmer, if set to true
# ktrim=r ---> “ktrim=r” is for right-trimming (3′ adapters)
# k=23 ---> look for kmer that is 23 bp long
# mink=11 ---> in addition to kmers of x length, look for shorter kmers with lengths 23 to 11 (in this case)
# maq=10 ---> This will discard reads with average quality below 10
# hdist=1 ---> hamming distance of 1
# mlf=50 ---> (minlengthfraction=50) would discard reads under 50% of their original length after trimming
# trimq=10 ---> quality-trim to Q10 using the Phred algorithm, which is more accurate than naive trimming.
# qtrim=r ---> means it will quality trim the right side only
# tpe ---> which specifies to trim both reads to the same length
# tbo ---> which specifies to also trim adapters based on pair overlap detection using BBMerge (which does not require known adapter sequences)

# more on hdist...
# A 4.6Mbp genome like E.coli contains around 4.6 million unique kmers. If a hamming distance is used, such as hdist=1, then the number of kmers stored will be
# multiplied by 1+(3*k)^hdist. So, for E.coli with K=31 and hdist=0, there are 4554207 kmers stored, using around 140MB, taking about 0.5 seconds; with
# hdist=1, there are 427998710 kmers stored (94 times as many), using 15GB, and taking 104 seconds
# BBDuk needs around 20 bytes per kmer

# BBDuk supports kmers of length 1-31. The longer a kmer, the high the specificity
# Note that it is impossible to do kmer matching for reference sequences that are shorter than K.
# When kmer filtering, you can specify a kmer length greater than 31 (such as k=40) for even higher specificity.
# For k=40, BBDuk will consider a read to match the reference if there are 10 consecutive 31-mer matches. This is not exactly the same as actually matching 40-mers, but is very similar.
